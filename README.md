The repository contains two distinct scripts designed for different tasks. You can use either one by itself or both together on the same page, depending on your requirements:

link-rewriter.js: Specifically targets <a> tags to modify URLs.

text-replacer.js: Performs a general search and replace across the entire page content.

Both scripts are designed to be configurable, so you don't need to edit the code itself.
